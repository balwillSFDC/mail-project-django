# Mail Project (Django)

## Summary
A Django project which replicates a retro ESP (Email Service Provider). Users can "send" emails to other users and reply back. The project does not actually send the email and instead mimicks an API call by making a request to itself and returning success and error responses. 

## Setup 
```dotnetcli
cd mail
python manage.py runserver
```
